## Welcome to My LeetCode Practice Page

There is a lot of collection of the daily codes that are asked by the Software Tech Companies.
Right now I am trying to complete the most frequently seen questions in our coding rounds and phone interviews.

### Your Help and Contribution
You can always point out if something is wrong or some test cases are not. Even though ofcourse these are pushed once the Leetcode question is passed however, I AM ALWAYS OPEN TO LEARNING - or efficient learning

### Want to Support, Contact or Simple like my code

## More interested in what I do and what are my goals?

How about go and check out **[my resume]**(https://github.com/nabiharaza/Resume/blob/master/Resume__Nabiha_Raza.pdf) 
or check out my **[personal website]**(https://www.cs.rit.edu/~nr6024/)
or maybe a **[linkedIn]**(https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabiha-raza/)

I think thats makes me pretty much reachable now :)

```python
if coding_result == "stressful":
    return ("Sip Coffee & Watch Silicon Valley")
else:
    return ("Carpe diem")
```
